Chirp is a wire protocol and API that supports communication between a
running job and a chirp server.  The HTCondor system provides a Chirp
server running in the \Condor{starter} that allows a job to perform
file I/O to and from the submit machine, update attribute in its own job
ad, and append the the user log file.  This service is off by default, 
and may be enabled by setting +WantIOProxy = true in the job ad.

The Chirp protocol is fully documented at \URL{http://www3.nd.edu/~ccl/software/chirp}

To provide easier access to this wire protocol, the \Condor{chirp} 
command line tool is shipped with HTCondor.  This tool provides full
access to the chirp commands.
