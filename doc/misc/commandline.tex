\index{API!Command line}

While the usual HTCondor command line tools are often not thought of
as an API, they are frequently the best choice for a programmatic
interface to the system.  They are the most complete, tested and debugged
way to work with the system.  The major downside of running the tools
is that spawning an executable may be relatively slow, but many applications
do not need an extreme level of performance.  Even some of the HTCondor 
tools themselves work this way:  When \Condor{dagman} needs to submit
a job, it simply spawn the \Condor{submit} program, just like an interactive
user would.
