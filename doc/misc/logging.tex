  The job event log is an optional, chronological list of events that occur
  as a job runs.
  The submit description file for the job requests a job event log with
  the submit command \SubmitCmd{log}.
  The log is created and remains on the submit machine.
  Contents of the log are detailed in section~\ref{sec:job-log-events}.
  Examples of events are that the job is running,
  that the job  is placed on hold, or that the job completed.
