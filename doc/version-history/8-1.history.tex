%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-1}Version 8.1.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.1.1 released on Month Date, 2013.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Reduced the number of calls to the service when managing EC2 jobs. This
should increase the number of EC2 jobs HTCondor can manage on a given service
without overloading it.
\Ticket{3683}

\item When configuration variable \Macro{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} is \Expr{True},
\Macro{SHARED\_PORT} will now be automatically added to \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}.
To disable this new behavior, set the new configuration variable:
\begin{verbatim}
  AUTO_INSERT_SHARED_PORT_IN_DAEMON_LIST = False
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{3799}

\item Floating point values in ClassAds are now printed as 64-bit
double precision values when sent over the network, written to disk, and
displayed using the \Opt{-long} or \Opt{-autoformat} options of
\Condor{status} and \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{3363}

\item In the Pegasus/DAGMan workflow metrics,
as documented in section ~\ref{sec:DAGMetrics},
the two metrics
\Expr{dagman\_id} and \Expr{parent\_dagman\_id} are now reported
as the \Attr{ClusterId} of the \Condor{dagman} job.  This
eliminates any privacy concerns with reporting the \Condor{schedd} 
daemon's address,
which includes the submit machine's IP address.

\item The python bindings now can perform the equivalent of 
\Condor{ping} as a part of the \texttt{SecMan} object.
\Ticket{3857}

\item The \Condor{gridmanager} and \Condor{ft-gahp} now create
dynamic security session for performing file transfers.
Previously, the security configuration had to be set in a special
way for file transfers with the \Condor{ft-gahp} to work.
\Ticket{3536}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} now accepts tabs in addition to spaces as delimiters.
\Ticket{3798}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{VALID\_SPOOL\_FILES} has been expanded
to accept a single asterisk wild card character in each listed file name.
\Ticket{3764}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{GAHP\_DEBUG\_HIDE\_SENSITIVE\_DATA}
is a boolean value that defaults to hiding sensitive data 
such as security keys and passwords
when communication with a GAHP server is written to a daemon log.
\Ticket{3536}

\item The default value of configuration variable 
\Macro{ENABLE\_CLASSAD\_CACHING} has changed to \Expr{True} for all
daemons other than the \Condor{shadow}, \Condor{starter}, and \Condor{master}.
\Ticket{3441}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{gridmanager} now does proper failure recovery when
submitting EC2 grid universe jobs to services that do not support 
the EC2 ClientToken parameter.
Previously, if there was a failure when submitting jobs to OpenStack
or Eucalyptus, the jobs could be submitted twice.
\Ticket{3682}

\item Fixed the printing of nested ClassAds, so that the nested ClassAds
can be read back properly.
\Ticket{3772}

\item Fixed a bug between the \Condor{gridmanager} and \Condor{ft-gahp}
that caused file transfers to fail if one of the two daemons was older
than version 8.1.0.
\Ticket{3856}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}
\item DAGMan recovery mode does not work for Pegasus-generated SUBDAGs.
For SUBDAGs, doing \Condor{hold} or \Condor{release} on
the \Condor{dagman} job, or stopping and re-starting the
\Condor{schedd} with the DAGMan
job in the queue will result in failure of the DAG.  This can be
avoided by doing a \Condor{rm} of the DAGMan job, which produces a Rescue
DAG, and re-submitting the DAG; the Rescue DAG is automatically run.
This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.0.1, and it also appears
in versions 8.0.2, 8.1.0, and 8.1.1.
\Ticket{3882}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-0}Version 8.1.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.0 released on August 5, 2013.
This release contains all bug fixes from the stable release version 8.0.1.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support for publishing information about an HTCondor pool 
to \TM{Ganglia}.
See section~\ref{sec:Config-gangliad} on 
page~\pageref{sec:Config-gangliad} for configuration variable details.
\Ticket{3515}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{collector} daemon when running
at sites that do not observe daylight savings time.
\Ticket{2898}

\item \Condor{q}, \Condor{rm}, \Condor{status} and \Condor{qedit} are now 
more consistent in the way they handle the \Opt{-constraint} option.
\Ticket{1156}

\item The new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable
with manual page at ~\pageref{man-condor-dagman-metrics-reporter},
reports metrics for DAGMan workflows running under Pegasus.  \Condor{dagman}
now generates an output file of the relevant metrics,
as described at ~\pageref{sec:DAGMetrics}.
\Ticket{3532}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default value of configuration variable
\Macro{COLLECTOR\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} has changed to 10240,
and the default value of configuration variable 
\Macro{SCHEDD\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} has changed to 4096.
This increases the scalability of the default configuration.
\Ticket{3626}

\item The new configuration variable
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} enables dynamic
adjustment of the level of file transfer concurrency in order to
keep the disk load generated by transfers below a specified level.
Supporting this new feature are configuration variables
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_WAIT\_BETWEEN\_INCREMENTS},
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_SHORT\_HORIZON}, and
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_LONG\_HORIZON}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The following new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd attributes are for
monitoring file transfer activity:
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToDownload},
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToUpload},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh}, and
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLow}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The default value for the configuration variable
\Macro{PASSWD\_CACHE\_REFRESH} has been changed from 300 seconds to
72000 seconds (20 hours).
\Ticket{3723}

\item The new configuration variables
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_METRICS} and
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_TIMEOUT}
set defaults used by the new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable,
which reports metrics for DAGMan jobs running under Pegasus.
\Ticket{3532}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.0.0 had an unintended change in the Chirp 
wire protocol.
This change caused \Condor{chirp} with the \Opt{put} option
to fail when the execute node
was running HTCondor version 7.8.x or earlier versions. 
HTCondor 8.0.1 and later
versions will now send the original wire protocol, and accept either the
original protocol, or the variant that HTCondor version 8.0.0 sends.
\Ticket{3735}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the daemons to crash on Unix platforms,
if the operating system reported that a job owner's account 
did not exist, for example due to a temporary NIS or LDAP failure.
\Ticket{3723}

\item Fixed a bug that resulted in a misleading error message when
\Condor{status} with the \Opt{-constraint} option specified a constraint 
that could not be parsed.
\Ticket{1319}

\item Fixed a typo in the output of \Condor{q},
where a period was erroneously present within a heading.
\Ticket{3703}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
