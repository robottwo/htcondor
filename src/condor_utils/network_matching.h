/*
 * Given a job ad, a machine ad, and a schedd ad, determine whether we have a network match.
 *
 * The TransferQueueUserExpr is taken from the schedd ad and evaluated in the scope of the match
 * ad of the job and machine.  This allows us to determine which transfer queue will be used
 * for the I/O related to this job.
 *
 * Next, the queued volume for the specified queue is looked up in the schedd ad and the bandwidth
 * between the machine and schedd is estimated.  If the backlog of transfers is too high, this
 * will return false.
 *
 * If any of the required attributes are missing, this will return true.
